        So right now there is a fairly large brush fire burning about five miles 
        from my house. We were without power for about two hours this afternoon
        because of it. This event, along with a conversation I had with my dad 
        this morning, caused me to reflect on some things.

        The first section of Isaac Asimov's novel <em>Foundation</em> features a 
        story of a young man, Gaal, from a planet on the outer rim traveling to the 
        Empire's capitol planet, Trantor, whose surface is entirely covered by 
        city (Much like Coruscant from Star Wars) for a new job. Gaal had never 
        been to Trantor and was exited to take a tour of the planet and see its 
        surface up close. All the locals ensured him that the surface would be 
        rather underwhelming but after arriving on the planet and spending some 
        time taking care of his accommodations for the night he gets on an elevator 
        to the surface to experience it for himself. The surface of Trantor was 
        only just a giant roof which covered everything, but while the spectacle
        was underwhelming as promised Gaal was happy to at least see the sky as 
        it was familiar to him unlike the maze of tunnels underneath the roof.

        A man on the same tour as Gaal could tell that he was not from Trantor and 
        struck up a conversation with him. He explains that all children born on 
        Trantor are required to periodically take trips up to the surface to experience
        and understand the sky. The children of Trantor did not like the feeling of 
        openness that existed on the surface, they much preferred to be below in the 
        place they were familiar, most never went back after they were no longer 
        required to. The maze of tunnels and windowless dwellings that were so 
        foreign to Gaal was what these children called home, they would probably 
        be completely unable to comprehend what life would be like in the rural 
        area that Gaal grew up.

        While we are not a part of any galactic empire, today there are many people 
        who are much like these children of Trantor. Several months ago there was a 
        tweet that went viral that had a picture of farmland in Kansas or Nebraska or 
        someplace like that taken from an airplane window, the caption of it was the 
        question "Does anyone know why the landscape looks like this?" Twitter had a 
        good time either roasting this guy (who was from some big East Coast city) for not 
        knowing what a farm was, or expressing how strange it was that the place looked
        like Minecraft, and yet in both of these groups of people there are many who
        believe that they know enough about the lifestyle of the other to think they 
        can make decisions on behalf of the people from places they don't understand.

        Today it is easy to divide ourselves into groups and stick to associating with 
        people only like ourselves. This is what politicians have been doing to us for 
        years now, here in America they have made so much progress at dividing the 
        population that so called centrist voters are almost statistically insignificant.
        This is a huge problem. Most people who live outside developing nations can't 
        comprehend life without electricity or running water. Similarly most people who 
        have spent their lives living in cities likely can't comprehend life in the country, and 
        would refuse to even try. The same is likely true for those who have grown up in the 
        country won't know what to think of city life. If anything close to world peace 
        will ever be achieved we need to seek to understand the perspectives of others,
        it is quite possible that people of different backgrounds are all a lot more similar than they
        assume.

        We cannot be like the children of Trantor who refuse to leave the bubble they were 
        born in. We may not have to leave it for long, but we need to be outside long 
        enough to understand the people outside.
