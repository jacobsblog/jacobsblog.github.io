    <h1>How to Buy Stuff on Ebay</h1>
    <h2>From a guy with one day of experience.</h2>

    <p>
        So as I mentioned the other day, I've been wanting to buy a new computer, 
        specifically I've been wanting a Thinkpad t420, (no not because it says 420, the 
        t420 is coincidentally considered one of the best Thinkpads among enthusiasts
        for other reasons)
        so where does one buy a laptop from before the end of the Mayan Calendar in 
        2020, Ebay of course.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the past several months I've looked at listings of various things on the 
        site, but never really with the intent to buy anything, but today I finally 
        used it to buy a t420, and I'd like to share the story.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Phase 1, Discovery
    </h3>
    <p>
        So for the past week or so I've been looking at various Thinkpad listings, I 
        wasn't really planning to buy anything right then yet, but looking back I'm 
        definitely glad that I did then so I was familiar with what was out there. 
        Originally I was looking for a complete system, but I realized that I'd probably 
        have to replace the battery and hard drive no matter what I got, and while getting 
        a charger with the computer is nice I soon realized that beggers can't be chosers
        and a replacement charger is only $12 bucks anyways. I also realized that I would 
        most likely need to upgrade the RAM since most of the t420s out there only had 
        4 gigs. I decided that I wanted something in the $100 to $150 price range. So 
        imagine my excitement when I saw a t420 that was already missing all the stuff 
        I was planning to replace, but that had a whole 16 gigs of RAM (more than I 
        would have upgraded to) with a current highest bid of only $45.

    <h3>
        Phase 2, Learning the System
    </h3>
    <p>
        The auction was ending in two hours, I saw the bids rise from 45 to 46 then 47.
        At one point I decided to up it by a dollar, just to see how bidding worked. 
        The instant I put in a bid someone else outbid me by another dollar. I knew it 
        was not likely for me to win like that, so I consulted YouTube on how to win 
        Ebay auctions, and learned the art from the scalpers who flip things on Ebay 
        for a living, I'd have to wait until the last second to strike.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Phase 3, The Winning Bid
    </h3>
    <p>
        Time went by, I don't know how exactly to explain the emotions I was feeling, 
        adrenaline was pumping through my veins, but at the same time I was calm, I 
        had the wisdom of the experts behind me. When there was about twenty minutes 
        left the bids were in the 60s. When there was thirty seconds left the bids rose 
        even quicker, 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 . . . I wasn't worried, I had my bid ready to
        submit and I started to look at the countdown, 10 9 8 7 6 5 4, right then I hit
        the place bid button I think the bid showing on the page was about $80 at that 
        point. A dialogue box quickly appeared with a red color, like the ones I'd seen 
        earlier after being outbid, but just as quickly as it appeared it was replaced 
        by a green one, and a second later the whole page updated. I clapped and 
        raised my hands in the air. I'd won the auction 
        with a bid of $125.
    </p>
    <p>
        The pros say that you should only ever bid at the last possible second and to 
        bid the highest amount you are willing to pay. I hit place bid at the four second 
        mark, the hardcore buyers would have said I did it too early since it only takes 
        two seconds for the system to register your bid, bidding early (especially by 
        days or even hours) will obviously only give others time to outbid you. But the 
        practice of only bidding with the most you're willing to pay can seem 
        counterintuitive, but it makes sense, trust me. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In most auctions, bidders only raise the bid by small amounts, on Ebay it is 
        typically only a dollar. If a similar auction was taking place in a live auction 
        house the auctioneer would be going, "I've got a $50, does anyone have $51? There's 
        a 51, how about 52? There's 52 and 53, how about 54? There's 54, and there's 55. 
        Anyone want to go 56? 56 anyone? 56? Alright, going once? Going twice? Sold to the 
        man in the orange hat for fifty-five dollars!" It is quite possible that the man in 
        the orange hat was willing to pay $75 for whatever he just bought, but since nobody 
        else was willing to go over $54, $55 was all he had to pay. The Ebay developers 
        realized this and incorporated that into their site. Before I hit the button the bids 
        were going 80 81 82, then I suspect that somebody else was waiting for the last second 
        just like I was with a $100 bid, and there was my $125 bid. In a real auction if the second 
        highest bid was only $100 I'd really only need to pay just above that to win, so even 
        though I bid $125, Ebay only charged me $102, a price much closer to what I would have 
        at a real auction.

        A week from now I should be receiving my new computer, along with parts from Amazon 
        to complete it. I trust that everything will run smoothly, but if it doesn't 
        Ebay's return and refund policies highly favor the buyer in the case of false 
        advertizement. According to those who frequently uses Ebay, buying stuff from 
        strangers on the internet is actually much safer than buying stuff online form 
        businesses who have the resources to protect themselves from their customers' 
        complaints. I look forward to getting my Thinkpad and starting my adventures in 
        Arch Linux.
