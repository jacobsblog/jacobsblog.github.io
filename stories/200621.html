        As you may recall from an earlier post I recently wrote a simple program that 
        helps me keep track of what books I own. I have finally finished using it to 
        index all the books I can bother to put in there and put the list it generated
        <a href="../library.html">here.</a> It was quite interesting to use a program 
        that I had developed for myself a few times I found myself making modifications
        to it as I kept using it. The source code for the program can be found 
        <a href="https://github.com/jsmit42/libraryTracker">here.</a> Feel free to use it,
        although if you do you probably want to contact me first (there is a simple bug I 
        was too lazy to fix but I'll do it if someone needs me to). You'll need a C++ compiler to use the program.

        I'm also considering buying an actual domain name and renting a private server to 
        host this site there. (I also want to see the look on peoples' face when I can tell
        them my email address is jacob@jacob.com or something like that) Changes are likely coming soon.
        Before then I'll probably work on making my home page less of a mess. (I've been putting that 
        off too long)
