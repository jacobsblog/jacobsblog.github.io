        So you've probably noticed that this site is a bit less ugly from before.
        While I've been waiting for my new computer to get here I've been planning 
        how exactly I want to configure it since I'll be installing the operating 
        system from scratch (which is something I of course don't need to do at all).
        While I was researching color themes I figured I'd do something I've been 
        procrastinating since I started this blog and put actual thought into the 
        appearance of this site.
    </p>
    <p>
        The colors I have changed to now are much closer to the ones that I really 
        wanted when I started this site, but when I did that I really didn't know 
        how to go about finding those colors. The inspiration for me to make this 
        site came from a guy who I'd have to say is the most interesting man on the 
        internet, <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith</a>, and I liked the asthenic 
        his site and wanted a similar one without copying his formatting (I want 
        the satisfaction of having built everything here from scratch). While 
        researching color themes for my new computer I realized that Luke's site's 
        colors were derived from the Vim theme Gruvbox (which I have already 
        forgotten the name of multiple times). My previous color scheme had eight 
        colors so I took the most prominent Gruvbox colors and put those in over the 
        rather uninspired ones I had.

        I know my way around HTML and CSS but I'm not a web designer, nor do I have 
        any interest in becoming one, today I learned the best way to handle aesthetic 
        decisions is to pick something based off of something that someone else 
        has already put weeks of thought into rather than do all the thinking 
        yourself.

        What's Next?
    </h3>
    <p>
        That's a wonderful question h3 tag, you're actually part of what's next. 
        Now that I have colors that I am actually happy with I'm going to make 
        an effort to make sure all of them can make regular appearances. You'll 
        notice that this post has a subtitle, I felt like my last post needed 
        one, then when I got my color scheme worked out I liked how it looked, 
        so posts will have subtitles going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I'm not currently happy with is my font, Times New Roman feels out 
        of place here, but again I am no web designer so testing new fonts seems 
        tedious and frustrating, so picking a new font is something I will probably 
        procrastinate indefinitely. 
    </p>
    <p>
        What I can't procrastinate indefinitely is fixing my homepage. I plan on 
        buying a domain name and renting a server to host this site on and when I 
        do I want to actually publicly announce the existence of this blog. I 
        can't direct people to an unfinished homepage (especially if all my 
        posts lead you back to it rather than the index of other posts). But I absolutely hate 
        making homepages, so we'll see how that turns out.
