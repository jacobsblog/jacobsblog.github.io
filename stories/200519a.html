    <h1>Trapped in a Cosmic Bathtub</h1>

    <p>
        This story is based on a script one of my roommates asked me to come up with in 
        like 20 minutes.
    </p>
    <hr>

    <p>
        Ensign Williams had a strange pain in his head. The last thing he remembered was 
        entering the starship's bridge to deliver a report to the Captain. Now he was 
        laying on the ground next to a toilet in a square room. There was nothing in the 
        room but the toilet and a bathtub. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Confused, Williams stood up to examine the bathtub. Inside was the Captain himself
        unconscious. He looked a bit rough, the shirt of his uniform was partially untucked
        and his hair was quite messy. Williams had never seen the Captain in this bad of shape,
        in the back of his mind he looked forward to being able to confirm to his friends that
        the Captain's hairstyle was indeed an elaborate comb-over, but he had more important 
        things to worry about at that moment.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Captain began to stir. Williams, startled, let out, "Captain! Captain!"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The Captain slowly opened his eyes then immediately sprung to life. "Ensign, what
        on Earth is going on?" he asked standing in the bathtub.
    </p>

    <p>
        Williams reported, "I don't know sir, the last thing I remember was entering the 
        bridge to deliver the bi-weekly life support systems status report then I suddenly 
        woke up in here with you."
    </p>

    <p>
        The Captain became visibly angry as it appeared he came to a dark realization. 
        "The Bermidians are in clear violation of Order 200519a of the warp-speed 
        freedom treaty."
    </p>

    <p>
        "You ordered the ship to travel at warp speed through Bermidian territory?"
    </p>

    <p>
        "We were carrying time sensitive cargo and needed to get to Tunicia as fast as
        possible, you knew that Ensign. We would not be in this predicament had the 
        Bermidians not been in violation of intergalactic law."
    </p>

    <p>
        Suddenly there was loud creaking in the pipes and the bathtub began to fill 
        rapidly. "The door Ensign!" the captain shouted.
    </p>

    <p>
        Williams frantically jiggled the door handle then proceeded to put his full 
        weight against it. "It won't budge Captain, we are locked in."
    </p>

    <p>
        The tub began to overflow. The Captain looked around the room. "Flush yourself
        down the toilet Ensign, it is our only way out of here."
    </p>

    <p>
        Williams stepped into the toilet and tried the lever. Water sprayed from the 
        top of the toilet bowl into the Ensign's boots.
        "I'm not going anywhere sir?"
    </p>

    <p>
        "Then it seems we are left here to die a drunk man's death, 
        drowned in a cosmic bathtub." were the last words of the formidable Captain Layneford.
