        Before the suggestion was deemed offensive, politicians, media personalities
        and other people who generally have no idea what they are talking about were 
        seeing the rise of the computer industry and suggesting that everyone 
        (excluding themselves of course) needed to learn computer programming because
        in that would be an essential skill for everyone to have. While it is true
        that more and more household appliances and devices are being sold with some 
        sort of internet connectivity or other advanced features, there will never 
        be a time in your life when you will need to edit and recompile the source 
        code of your smart fridge, and even if you thought you did smart fridge 
        manufacturers wouldn't let you. Where these people do have a point is in the 
        fact that the software industry has been growing since it's inception and 
        is projected to continue in its nearly exponential growth, and while 
        programming is a great job, it (like any other job) is not for everyone.

        So why is it that I think you should learn to code? Why is it that you should
        learn how to use simple tools? Using a hammer ceased to be an essential skill 
        years ago, and as far as I can tell IKEA is trying their hardest to rid the planet of 
        phillips head screws, but proper use of these tools have not ceased to be useful.
        With an understanding of how to use basic tools you can build yourself a shelf
        to put things on or craft some piece of artwork to enjoy, sure professionals will 
        be able to do a better job but there is no substitute for the satisfaction of 
        having built something yourself. There are also some cases where what you need 
        or envision is not really available. Recently I helped my dad build a gate large 
        enough to back all of his trailers into the side yard. Because of the shape and 
        slope of the area we were putting it in, a traditional swinging gate wouldn't 
        have been feasible so we manufactured a solution that allowed us to easily 
        remove and replace the fence panels rather than swinging them. The solution 
        to our problem wasn't one that could be achieved without the arguably non-essential 
        skills we had. Whatever reasons you have to learn how to use a hammer translate
        to reasons to learn to code.

        In the past few months I have come up with these sorts of scenarios as reasons 
        for me to write various programs. In a recent article I wrote on this blog I 
        expressed my intention to write an RSS reader because I am dissatisfied with 
        the ones available to me. Another, much simpler, project I want to work on is 
        to recreate a minigame that my sister and I played on a Playstation 1 at our 
        great great aunt's house once. Also a rather unique problem I have is that I 
        shop for books at thrift stores often and can end up accidentally buying books 
        that I already own, this is one I have been able to solve with a simple program 
        that I wrote in only about two hours over the weekend that allows me to enter 
        in all the books I own to be saved, sorted and formatted to be easily put in a
        web page on this site so that wherever I am I can see what is in my library, 
        and you will be able to as well if you're curious. I'm not interested in any 
        of these projects so that I can put them on a resume, I want to build and 
        improve these things because they are things that I will actually use.

        With the right knowledge and skill, even if it is only a little, you can see 
        solutions that you may have never thought of, or even solutions to problems 
        you didn't even know yuo had. I once read a story of a guy who had a job that 
        boiled down to basic data entry on a computer. It would take all of the guy's 
        coworkers a full day to complete a full document, but he realized that the 
        task could be automated so he wrote a basic program to enter the data for him
        and he was able to finish multiple documents a day. His employer, not realizing 
        that he had automated his job, saw his output, assumed that he was typing the 
        data at an incredible speed and laid off his coworkers since he was doing their 
        job on top of his, when in reality the guy would just run the script only a few 
        times and sat at his desk doing nothing most of the day. People without the know-how 
        don't see what could be or are afraid to try it. I once had a job fairly similar 
        to this guy's, I wish I had explored the possibility of automating my work rather 
        than straining my hands doing the same repetitive task over and over again for 
        weeks.

        Anyone can benefit from learning the basics of programming. My favorite YouTube 
        channel is one by a guy named Luke Smith (he was actually my inspiration for making this site). Most of his videos highlight various 
        Linux programs and functions. Most people on YouTube making Linux content are 
        computer programmers or networking geeks, but not this guy, he is about to 
        become a PHD linguist and has a bachelor's in economics. He has never had any 
        formal training in programming but he has written his own custom email client
        that provided offline functionality that he needed but other services didn't 
        offer. The guy has made more programs and scripts for his own use than many 
        professionals ever will for theirs.

        In conclusion, you should learn to code, for the same reason that you should 
        learn to use a hammer, or to maintain your own sprinkler system, or to work on 
        your own car. Sure you may never have or want a job doing any of these things, 
        but when you find the use for certain skills it sure is great to have them.
