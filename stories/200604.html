        It was approaching 5:00 in Ergthor's office, the weekend was upon him and
        the recently re-elected Emperor of the universe had realized that his chronic 
        boredom had reached the point where he had to do something about it. He 
        grabbed his phone to call in his Lieutenant Governor for urgent business.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lieutenant Governor Garth Wormtoss entered the room still in his imperial 
        uniform from the Lunar New Year ceremony on Jantu earlier that day. He 
        found the Emperor leaning back in his chair reaching into his whiskey cabinet
        "You summoned me my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
        "There is no need for formalities Garth there is no official business to deal 
        with," Ergthor replied while pouring shots for the two of them. "We've just
        won our fifth consecutive unopposed election for ultimate power in the universe
        and after all this time I've come to realize how boring this job really is after
        succeeding in inserting our men in the governments of all the central systems.
        All we ever do these days is warp across the galaxy to recognize holidays that 
        nobody cares about outside the flyover planets our secretaries force us to land
        on, and that is when we aren't forced into presiding over the galactic senate as 
        they squabble over warp drives damaging the fabric of our dimension apart or some 
        other ridiculous idea they want me to care about."
    </p>
    <p>
        "Sir. . ." the Lieutenant Governor started before realising he had noting to say.
    </p>
    <p>
        "I said cut the formalities Garth. We've been best friends since the Academy, 
        we used to go on crazy adventures together. When was the last thing we did
        anything fun?"
    </p>
    <p>
        Garth took a sip of whiskey and answered, "Well watching the final arena battles 
        on Tonrock last month was quite fun, but we have to wait a few more years for a 
        new set of warriors to prepare to fight each other to the death like that again."
    </p>
    <p>
        The Emperor placed his glass down and exclaimed, "Ahhh we were only spectators
        then Garth, back in the good old days we used to run off and do whatever we felt
        like, remember that time we took a whole week off of school to bury the bones of
        giant Saurian beasts all over that one planet of primitives and were never 
        noticed?"
    </p>
    <p>
        "I'm not sure I would classify hiding from the authorities by recklessly flying a 
        stolen mining vessel through an asteroid belt through an asteroid field as 'never 
        noticed' but I see what you are thinking of now. I wonder if they ever found that
        stuff, or what is going on on that planet."
    </p>
    <p>
        "That's what we need to do, we always had fun messing with those planets, meet
        me in the royal hangar in three hours and we'll go there to get some excitement back."
    </p>
    <p>
        "What will we do when we get there?"
    </p>
    <p>
        "I don't know Garth we can figure it out when we get there."
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Ergthor and Garth didn't manage to think of anything to do on their trip over 
        so they decided to ask the locals what they did for fun. They figured that 
        the power they had held for so long had desensitized themselves from the joys 
        that life had to offer and they needed to be educated by someone whose life 
        had never been tarnished by intergalactic politics.

        Jeremy woke in the middle of the night to the blurry image of two giant green men standing at the 
        edge of his bed. "If you are going to stick your cameras up there you'd probably 
        prefer that I use the restroom first," he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Sir it appears that this man thinks we are here to preform research of the 
        digestive system of his species. Of all the things we thought of doing that
        is by far more boring than all of them," Garth said.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Wait you speak English?" Jeremy asked.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Of course we speak English Earth-man, what else are we supposed to speak?" Ergthor
        replied. "We have no scholarly pursuits on this planet, we are here seeking 
        inspiration from your planet on how we can put excitement back into our lives."
    </p>
    <p>
        The Earth-man sat confused in his bed for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
        "What do you like to do for fun Earth-man?" Garth asked.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Ahh, why didn't you just start with that?" Jeremy replied, "Come to my garage."
    </p>
    <p>
        The Earth-man began babbling about the rush of happiness he feels when driving
        around at high speeds as the three walked down to his garage. Ergthor and Garth 
        were visibly confused as they were under the impression that this planet had yet 
        to develop warp drives and could therefore not travel anywhere near what they 
        considered high speeds. They became even more visibly puzzled as they entered a 
        garage full of land vehicles.
        Jeremy of course did not pick up on any of the alien social ques and continued 
        explaining the benefits of different engines and why V8s are so much better than 
        the powerless machines companies were making these days even if their tiny engines
        were fitted with turbos.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Earth-man was in the middle of explaining something about manual transmissions
        when Ergthor interrupted him deciding that he needed first hand experience with 
        this sort of thing if this man could be so enthusiastic about this primitive 
        technology. "Take me on a ride Earth-man." 
    </p>
    <p>
        It took quite some time for Ergthor to fit in Jeremy's favorite car but once he was
        in and the Earth-man had started the vehicle the Emperor of the galaxy could
        sense that he was in for a treat. He could feel the rumble of the engine and 
        hear the oddly satisfying sound of the exhaust being expelled out the back. 
        The acceleration of the car entering what the Earth-man called high speeds was 
        a provided a feeling that was rarely present on modern spacecraft then the 
        feeling of flagrantly drifting around corners was something that Ergthor had 
        nothing to compare to. Upon leaving the planet to return to his dull life as 
        Emperor of the galaxy, Ergthor knew how to fill the missing piece of his life.
