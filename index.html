        So I decided to make an intentionally "ugly" looking blog in order to have 
        some sort of creative outlet, because I really like writing and I don't 
        have many excuses to do it.
    </p>

    <p>
        What may or may not end up here:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Peeks into the mind of Jacob</li>
        <li>Short Stories</li>
        <li>Poems</li>
        <li>Book Review like things</li>
        <li>Essays on interesting but also dumb things</li>
        <li>Other random stuff</li>
        <li>And whatever else blogs are "supposed" to have</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Really I don't know. This site is to be a call-back to the old days of the internet
        before it was dominated by multi billion dollar corporations. The world wide web
        was once more like the wild west.
    </p>

        I think this might be fun, but I first have to perfect my brand of "ugly". 
        If everyone else stopped making websites using just HTML and CSS, I don't 
        have to jump off that cliff with them. I don't care for "modern" web design,
        I care for fun things.
    </p>
    <p>
        But a cliff I should jump off is some terms of service. While I craft some sort 
        of official looking parody of a terms of service page I must say that by using this, 
        wait, I can make this look more official . . . 
    </p>

    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>

    <p>
        By using this 
        site you recognize that I take no responsibility for anything stupid that you do.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>

    <p>
        The official email address for this blog is: jacobsblog@ nope no it isn't, yandex 
        is being dumb, let me make a new account somewhere else.
    </p>

    <p>
        Okay it's jacobsblog@zohomail.com 
    </p>

    <p>
        If I'm going to have a blog I need a specified email for it.
